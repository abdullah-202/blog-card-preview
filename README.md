### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)



### Continued development

I am still lacking in understanding some tailwindCSS components. For instance the shadow for this card can only be added (according to me) by plain CSS and doesn't get any classes from tailwind. Maybe using custom properties we can add it so wanted to explore it more.
